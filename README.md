# Vet School Prep Journal

Welcome to my vet school prep journal! This repository is where I keep track of all my notes, reflections, and progress as I work toward applying to vet school. Think of it as my personal hub for everything related to my prep journey.

## What’s Inside

- Logs of volunteer or work hours  
- Resources and tips I find helpful  

## How I Use This

I update this repository regularly to stay organized and keep a record of my growth. It’s also a way to look back and see how far I’ve come in preparing for vet school.
